                1. Thread Class
                The Thread class provides constructors and methods for creating and managing threads. To create a new 
                thread, you can either extend the Thread class or implement the Runnable interface.
                                
                2. Runnable Interface
                The Runnable interface should be implemented by any class whose instances are intended to be executed 
                by a thread. The class must define a method called run that contains the code to be executed.
                
                3.Multithreading
                Multithreading in Java is a powerful feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more threads to 
                achieve maximum CPU utilization. Each thread runs in  parallel, allowing for complex and efficient 
                multitasking.
